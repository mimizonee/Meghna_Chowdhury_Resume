						<h4>To develop an efficient technique to solve community detection problem in Multi-view information network:</h4>
						<p>
							A graph-based convolutional network for learning on multi-view networks by introducing preservation and 
							collaboration parameters and effectively optimizing them using Non Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm 
							is implemented using Tensorflow, Scikitlearn, Spectral library
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Continuous Encoding for Community Detection in Attribute Networks:</h4>
						<p>
							A Graph Neural Network Encoding method for multi-objective evolutionary algorithms to handle the 
							community detection problem in complex attribute networks is implemented using python.
						</p>
					</li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Overlapping Community Detection with Graph Neural Networks: </h4>
                        <p>
                            Disjoint communities can be detected however in real graphs communities are well known to be overlapping. 
							Hence we are working on a Graph Neural Network based model for overlapping community detection. 
                        </p>
                    </li>
